# Starfield-Helper
A collection of various scripts related to Starfield

A few simple/quick scripts whose purpose is to save my hands from Starfield.  Written in AHK to save time and effort.  Please see www.autohotkey.com to install it.

The sc-craft-spam(1080p) may only work with 1080 resolution and has a small quirk that the mouse must be wiggled for it to actually move to the 99 craft pixel.  If you accidentally move the mouse it should move back on its own though.
The block mouse will work despite the resolution by pressing F12 after you hover it over the mouse of your desired crafting amount.  

I will eventually(maybe?) add some more or throw these together to make everything run off of one script file.  Please see the actual code for the hotkeys.

TODO:
Combine Hotkeys into single script.
Add a kill all toggles hotkey.
Use windows detection to make sure Starfield.exe is in the foreground and if not pause hotkeys.
